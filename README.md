# Info

I made this config mostly inspired by a lot of the packer.nvim, lua based neovim configs
I've based my own configs off other's works before, but never 100% written one from scratch, always using a base

Goals: 
- Simple theme management
- Relative speed (doesn't need to fly, but I can't have something weighing down too much)
- Lots of specific functionality for my personal needs 

If you plan on using this as your personal config (which I'm thankful for), there's several things you can do:
- Make sure to run :PackerSync after instalation, report any issues on this repo
- You change the theme and add your own by making a themename.lua in lua/themes/ and the same for your lualine colors in lua/themes/lualine
- I use an odd specific set of plugins, so you can play with that section of lua/plugins.lua and remove some, make sure to run :PackerSync after that.
